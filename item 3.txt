BOARD.
David Carson - American graphic designer, art director, and  surfer. Self taught, Carson in his art is experimental and trendy. His style is loved by many, because it is so unique and isn’t traditional, which makes him stand out. Some of his famous projects were art directing the Ray Gun Magazine and his work for Transworld Skateboarding.  We chose him because of his experimental style, and because he is up to date with current trends. Another reason we chose him is because he isn’t afraid to speak his mind.
