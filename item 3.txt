Having equality amongst the customers and employees will create a safe and comfortable work space for everyone to share their visions in. Discrimination and unequality will not be tolerated under any cirsumstances.
Safe Work Environment
We will make sure that our employees will be working in an environment that they feel comfortable working in. We will fulfill our employees needs in order for them to get their work done and provide them with things such as a proper workstation or accommodations for food and drinks. The health of our employees is very important to us because they are what keeps this company running.
Avoid creating works that are deemed harmful
We do not tolerate hate or discrimination. We have the right to refuse if we decide that a customer's request is seen to be harmful, offensive, or abusive towards certain individual and groups. In such cases, we will only proceed if the benefits greatly outweigh the harm done and we will ensure that all safety precautions are taken.
