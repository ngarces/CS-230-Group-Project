# Item 4: Experimentation & Prorities

**OKR:**
1. Our objective is to create designs and graphics to help promote our clients products and visions.
2. Our Key result is the success of our client in promoting their product.

## A. Experimentation
1. Our experiment will involve having a company volunteer to have us create a design or logo for them. We will havea graphic designer create the prototype (design or logo) using graphic design applications such as Photoshop or Pixlr based on the volunteer's vision. We will let the volunteer use our design for their company for a period of time. Afterwards, we will measure our success by measuring our client's success in promoting their product through the use of surveys and customer data reports to evaluate how satisfied they are with our design.
    * Our hypothesis is that many consumers will enjoy our graphics because we follow many trends, and we are up to date with our artistry.
    * We will ensure this because we do research, explore and discover the many artistic trends society prefers to see visually. We conduct surveys and we also reach out to the consumers to ask what they would like to see on a product.
2. Another experiment we could conduct is creating a few different designs/logos with their own unique characteristics. We would then put them out on a survey for the public to choose which one they would prefer to buy and which one attracts them more. With this experiment we would be able to see what design techniques attract customers the most. Using the results from the surveys we would try to implement those trends in our actual designs.

## B. Priorities
We would like to test our first experiment involving another client because it involves working with others outside our company and putting our sklls out there for customers to see and give us feedback.
