## E. Strategies

### Competitor: Landor
* We learned from our competitor use a client-driven approach. We will start off by finding trends in what our customers want and cater to their needs as well as following new trends based on what the public wants.
* We will also keep up with other businesses and observe the a*rtistic trends to help advertise product in a unique way.
* We differentiate from other graphic design companies because we prioritize our customers and view them as partners who we have a close relationship with, rather than people we are doing business for.
* We define success by the outcome of our customers' profitablity.
   
### Key Milestones & Checkpoints
Over the years we hope to expand to working with more and more businesses. Starting out we will help other small businesses or startups with their graphic design needs and make a name for ourselves in the graphic design market. In a few years or so hopefully we will expand to helping larger businesses not only in the bay area but also in southern California or the entire state of California. The next step after that would to be working with business that work all over the United States so our work will be seen in popular commercials on TV and billboards in major cities. A long term goal that we hope to reach in 5 years is to  work with international businesses like airlines that travel around the world so our designs can be seen globally.
