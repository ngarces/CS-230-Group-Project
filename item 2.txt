Core Values: 
We want to be thought of as a customer friendly platform for everyone with a creative vision for their company. 
One of our core values are Equality amongst our customers. We don't treat them as customers or people we are just working with, but as a collaborator. We respect ideas and creative vision, and we build and create something based on that. Whether you have an idea or not, we are always willing to establish some sort of idea for a project. We also don't favor one customer over the other. 
Another core value we have is passion. As a company, we have passion towards helping our customers. Since we are a graphic company, we certainly do have passion for doing graphics, and for making others' unleash their inner artist.
