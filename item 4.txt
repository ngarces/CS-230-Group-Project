A. Experimentation
Our experiment will involve having a company volunteer to have us create a design or logo for them. We will havea graphic designer create the prototype (design or logo) using graphic design applications such as Photoshop or Pixlr based on the volunteer's vision. We will let the volunteer use our design for their company for a period of time. Afterwards, we will measure our success by measuring our client's success in promoting their product through the use of surveys and customer data reports to evaluate how satisfied they are with our design.
