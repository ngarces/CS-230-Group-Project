# Item 2: Cultural Policy

## A. Core Values 

* We want to be thought of as customer friendly, creative platform. 
* One of our core values is equality amongst our customers. We don't treat them as customers or people we are just working with, but as collaborators. We respect ideas and creative vision, and we build and create something based on that. Whether you have an idea or not, we are always willing to establish some sort of idea for a project. We also don't favor one customer over the other. 
* We want to maintain integrity with our customers. We will maintain transparency and open communication during our time helping our customers so that they are aware of everything throughout the process on our end.

## B. Motivation
For us the most important goal and purpose is to satisfy our customers and provide them with our best services. We love to work together with our customers to come up with a creative and eye-catching design to promote their product. Our fear would definitely be to have our customers leave unhappy and feeling neglected. That is why we strive to make sure we are collaborating with them to the best of our ability and giving them a successful end product.
